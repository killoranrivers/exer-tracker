- Add Heroku URL to README
- Update README with technologies used
- Move nodemon to root package.json
    - Delete from back end package.json
    - Install from root after doing git init (Should it just be global?)
- Figure out how to use heroku prebuild and postbuild so it will run start script from serverâ€™s package.json instead of the root package.json
